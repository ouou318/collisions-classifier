# Data Explore for Data Incubator
This is my page for the mini project explore for data incubator. 

## Sources
Seattle Traffic Collisions Dataset This dataset maintained by the city of seattle contains traffic collision report details from 2004 to present. This will be my main datasource for collision data. https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/collisions
There are other supporting datasets:

- Seattle street data: https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Seattle_Streets_OD.pdf
- Seattle street sign: https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Street_Signs_OD.pdf
- Seattle historical weather data: https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/archive/export/seattle_united-states-of-america_5809844

## Key Points
- Some locations had more accidents and are more dangerous.
- There are important features that tend to cause more fetal accidents: time, type of collisions, weather, and speed.
- A lot to explore!
